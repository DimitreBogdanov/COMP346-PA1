Task 1: Atomicity bug hunt
The main reason why the requirement is not met is because the operations done on multiple threads trying to access
the same object are not done in sequence, where one would wait for the previous to finish, instead they access
and modify the object as soon as the system allows them to. This situation causes the data in the account objects
to be inconsistently modified. The bug that is causing it is the fact that the Account.debosit and Account.withdraw
methods are not synchronized, allowing concurent access to the object which causes data corruption.

Task 2: Starting Order
The start order of the threads is determined by...
<lifetime of a thread>
<experiment>
The consistency is preserved regardless of the order in which threads are run.

Task 3: Method level synchronization
See code

Task 4: Block level synchronization
See code

Task 5: synchronized block vs synchronized methods
